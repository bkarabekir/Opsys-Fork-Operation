# OpSys-Fork-Operation

Fork


Create a full binary process tree with height = 2,3,4,..
Each of the processes in the tree will create a text file with their own process id.		
Each	of the child processes will write a random number into the text	file.		
Each	parent will sum the random number from children and write it into its text file.	
Finally the top(Parent/Root) process will print out the sum of all random numbers generated by the child nodes.		
You can read the man page of	function to get the pid in Linux.		
	
• Child Process: Creates	a random number and writes it	into	a file named with its	own process id.		
• Parent Process: Sums the values written by its child processes	and writes summation into a file named with its own pid or print the result screen.
